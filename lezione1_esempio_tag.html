            <br><strong>&#8221Folder Color&#8221 Tool Adds Support for Ubuntu 22.10
            </strong></br>
            </p> 
            <u>You’re probably already familiar with <mark><i>Folder Color</i></mark>, a terrifically nifty tool that makes it easy to change the colour of folder icons in Nautilus.</u>
            <p>Well, I’ve some good news: it recently added support for <mark>Ubuntu 22.10 and GNOME 43</mark>. This means you can continue to change the colour of any folder in Nautilus (as well as badge folders with a selection of emblems) to suit your own tastes.<p>If you’ve used the tool in earlier versions of Ubuntu/Nautilus then nothing has changed: right-click on any folder in the file manager and page into the &#8221folder color &#8221 menu to pick a hue from the list available. The change applies instantly.
            </p>
            <p>
            <br><strong>Installing Folder Color on Ubuntu 22.10</strong><br>
            <br>First, add the official Folder Color <mark>PPA</mark> — yes, a <mark>PPA</mark>; a rarity these days — to your Kinetic Kudu-based system buy running this command in a terminal app of your choosing:
            <p><br><cite>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:costales/folder-color
            </cite></br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Then run this command to install Folder Color on <mark>Ubuntu 22.10</mark>, and restart the Nautilus file manager to make sure all of the new folder colour features click in to place, as intended:
            </p>
            <p><br><cite>sudo apt install folder-color && nautilus -q</br></cite>
            </p>
            <p><u>If you upgraded from an earlier version of Ubuntu and the tool already installed: uninstall it first, then add the PPA, and then reinstall it.To install the Caja version run sudo apt install folder-color-caja, and restart.</u>
            </p>
            <p><strong><i>In all, nice tool — great to see it updated!</i></strong>
